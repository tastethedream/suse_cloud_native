# Lesson 5 : CI/CD Cloud Native Tools

## The CD Fundamentals

Once an engineering team has automated the packaging of an application, the next phase is to release it to customers. Before the application is pushed to a production environment, it is important to check the functionality of an application when deployed and integrated with platform components. Only when the application meets the excepted behavior, it is deployed to a customer-facing environment. The process of propagating an application through multiple environments, until it reached the end-users, is known as the Continuous Delivery (or CD) stage.

It is common practice to push the code through at least 3 environments: sandbox, staging, and production. A reminder of each environment's purpose :

 - *Sandbox* - development environment, where new changes can be tested with minimal risk.

-*Staging* - an environment identical to production, and where a release can be simulated without affecting the end-user experience.

- *Production* - customer-facing environment and any changes in this environment will affect the customer experience.

The sandbox and staging environments are fully automated. As such, if the deployment to sandbox is successful and meets the expected behavior, then the code will be propagated to the staging automatically. However, the push to production requires engineering validation and triggering, as this is the environment that the end-users will interact with. The production deployment can be fully automated, however, doing so implies a high confidence rate that the code will not introduce customer-facing disruptions.

Within the deployment pipeline, Continuous Delivery covers the *deploy* stage. Throughout this course, we have practiced the deployment of an application while using `kubectl` commands.

Kubernetes CLI (kubectl), support the management of imperative and declarative configuration. With the imperative approach, a Python hello-world application is deployed by creating a Deployment resource and referencing the desired Docker image:

```
# deploy `python-helloworld` using the imperative approach
kubectl create deploy python-helloworld --image=pixelpotato/python-helloworld:v1.0.0
```

On the other side, with the declarative approach, the Python hello-world Deployment is store in a YAML manifest and is created using the `kubectl apply` command:

```
# deploy `python-helloworld` using the declarative approach
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
 The _declarative_ approach is the recommended way to deploy resources within a production environment. Hence, this configuration management technique will be referenced in the next sections.

 ## Argo CD

 The ecosystem is rich in the collection of tools that automate the Continuous Delivery stage, such as Jenkins, CircleCI, Concourse, and Spinnaker. However, in this lesson, we will explore ArgoCD to propagate an application to multiple Kubernetes clusters.

ArgoCD is a declarative Continuous Delivery tool for Kubernetes, which follows the GitOps patterns. As such, ArgoCD operates on configuration stored in manifests (declarative) and uses Git repositories as the source of truth for the desired state of an application (GitOps pattern). As such, ArgoCD monitors the new commits to Git repositories and applies the latest changes reconciled automatically or on a manual trigger. Additionally, ArgoCD offers deployment to target environments and multiple clusters, and support for multiple config management tools (such as plain YAML, Helm, Kustomize).

For application deployment through multiple environments, ArgoCD provides CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) to configure and manage the application release.

### Project resource

The Project resource is a CRD that provides a logical grouping of applications, including access to source and destination repositories, and permissions to resources within the cluster. This resource is handy to segregate and control the deployment to multiple clusters.

### Application resource

The Application resource that stores the configuration of how an application should be deployed and managed.
Let's explore how a Python hello-world application is deployed using an ArgoCD Application resource: Note: It is assumed that the declarative manifests for Python hello-world are available ((e.g. deploy.yaml, service.yaml, etc).

```
## API endpoint used to create the Application resource
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
## Set the name of the resource and namespace where it should be deployed.
## In this case the Application resource name is set to  `python-helloworld `
## and it is deployed in the `argocd` namespace
metadata:
  name: python-helloworld
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  ## Set the target cluster and namespace to deploy the Python hello-world application.
  ## For example, the Python hello-world application is deployed in the `default` namespace
  ## within the local cluster or `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  ## Set the project the application belongs to.
  ## In this case the `default` project is used.
  project: default
  ## Define the source of the Python hello-world application manifests.
  ## In this example, the manifests are stored in the `argocd-demo` repository
  ## under the `python-manifests` folder. Additionally, the latest commit within
  ## the repository is targeted or `HEAD`.
  source:
    path: python-manifests
    repoURL:
    https://github.com/kgamanji/argocd-demo
    targetRevision: HEAD
  # # Set the sync policy.
  ## If left empty, the sync policy will default to manual.
  syncPolicy: {}
```

### App of Apps

ArgoCD provides an ???app-of-apps??? technique that enables a group of applications to be deployed and configured together. This technique is useful if a product is developed using a microservice-based architecture, and a single point of orchestration is necessary to deploy all microservices. For example, a Web-store Application CRD can be used to manage the Application CRDs for the UI, Login, and Payment units. In this case, one point of control is provisioned to release and manage multiple microservices.

### ArgoCD Advantages

- Application Context
 - Source Git respositories
 - Destination clusters
 - Permissions

#### Application

- Custom source Definition
- Manage deployment of Kubernetes resources


### CD Fundamentals Exercise

ArgoCD is a Kubernetes-native tool that is capable of automating the life cycle management of application YAML manifests. With the GitOps model, configuration changes reconcile with minimal manual intervention, reaching an efficient deployment mechanism.

The following snippet highlights the commands to deploy ArgoCD and expose it using a NodePort service:

```
# deploy ArgoCD
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

```
# Create the NodePort service for ArgoCD server by using the
# `kubectl apply -f argocd-server-nodeport.yaml` command
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: server
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-server
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
  name: argocd-server-nodeport
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30007
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30008
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-server
  type: NodePort
```

Once logged in to the ArgoCD server, applications can be created. The declarative manifest for nginx-alpine Application CRD can be found below:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: nginx-alpine
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: exercises/manifests
    repoURL: https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1
    targetRevision: HEAD
  # Sync policy
  syncPolicy: {}
```
